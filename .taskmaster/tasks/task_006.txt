# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Restore Scheduler and Drill Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the scheduler for periodic restore drills and the engine to execute and validate restore operations.
# Details:
Create a system to schedule and execute periodic restore drills to validate backup integrity and restore processes. The system should support configurable drill frequencies, success thresholds, and validation criteria.

Components:
- Drill scheduler with configurable policies
- Restore execution engine
- Validation framework for restored databases
- Reporting and alerting for drill results
- Metrics collection for RTO validation

Pseudo-code:
```
class RestoreDrillEngine:
  def schedule_drill(db_type, frequency):
    # Add to drill schedule
    drill_scheduler.add(db_type, frequency)
    
  def execute_drill(db_instance):
    # Find latest backup
    snapshot_ref = find_latest_snapshot(db_instance)
    
    # Provision test instance
    test_instance = provision_test_instance(db_instance.type)
    
    # Execute restore
    restore_driver = get_restore_driver(db_instance.type)
    result = restore_driver.execute_restore(snapshot_ref, test_instance)
    
    # Validate restored database
    validation = restore_driver.validate_restored_db(test_instance)
    
    # Record metrics and report results
    record_rto_metrics(result.start_time, result.end_time, snapshot_ref.size)
    report_drill_result(db_instance, result, validation)
    
    return validation.success
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for drill scheduling logic
2. Integration tests with restore drivers
3. End-to-end drill tests in isolated environments
4. RTO measurement validation
5. Alert and reporting verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Drill Scheduler with Configurable Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the scheduler component that manages periodic restore drills based on configurable policies
### Details:
Create a scheduler that maintains a database of drill configurations with frequency settings per database type. Implement cron-like scheduling logic to trigger drills at appropriate intervals. Include configuration options for time windows, blackout periods, and priority levels. The scheduler should be resilient to restarts and maintain state in a persistent store.

## 2. Build Restore Execution Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement the core engine that executes restore operations from backups to test environments
### Details:
Develop the execution engine that provisions temporary test instances, identifies appropriate backup snapshots, and orchestrates the restore process. Include retry logic for failed restores, resource management for test instances, and cleanup procedures after drill completion. The engine should support parallel execution of multiple drills while respecting resource constraints.

## 3. Create Validation Framework for Restored Databases [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop a framework to validate the integrity and functionality of restored databases
### Details:
Implement a pluggable validation framework that can verify restored databases across different technologies. Include basic validation checks (connectivity, schema integrity) and support for custom validation scripts. The framework should measure validation metrics like data completeness, query performance, and structural integrity. Support both automated and manual validation workflows.

## 4. Implement Reporting and Alerting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Build a comprehensive reporting and alerting system for restore drill results
### Details:
Develop a reporting system that tracks drill results, success rates, and validation outcomes. Implement alerting for failed drills, validation errors, and missed RTO targets. Create dashboards showing drill history, success trends, and compliance status. Include notification channels for email, Slack, and PagerDuty with appropriate severity levels based on failure impact.

## 5. Develop RTO Metrics Collection and Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement metrics collection and analysis for Recovery Time Objective (RTO) validation
### Details:
Create a metrics collection system that measures key restore performance indicators including total restore time, data transfer rates, and validation duration. Implement analysis tools to compare actual restore times against RTO requirements. Build trending reports to identify performance degradation over time. Include database size normalization for fair comparisons across different instances.
