# Task ID: 10
# Title: Extend Database Technology Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement support for additional database technologies (Zookeeper, Docstore, Schemaless) in the backup and restore frameworks.
# Details:
Extend the backup and restore driver frameworks to support additional database technologies as specified in the PRD. Implement technology-specific plugins for Zookeeper, Docstore, and Schemaless.

Components:
- Zookeeper backup/restore plugin
- Docstore backup/restore plugin
- Schemaless backup/restore plugin
- Testing and validation for each technology
- Documentation for technology-specific considerations

Implementation approach:
1. Research each database technology's backup/restore mechanisms
2. Implement consistent snapshot creation for each technology
3. Develop restore validation logic specific to each technology
4. Test with varying database sizes and configurations
5. Document technology-specific limitations and best practices

Pseudo-code for Zookeeper plugin:
```
class ZookeeperBackupDriver implements BackupDriver:
  def create_snapshot(zk_instance):
    # Connect to Zookeeper instance
    client = connect_to_zookeeper(zk_instance)
    
    # Trigger snapshot creation
    client.take_snapshot()
    
    # Package snapshot files
    snapshot_files = collect_snapshot_files(zk_instance.data_dir)
    return create_snapshot_archive(snapshot_files)
    
  def validate_snapshot(snapshot):
    # Validate Zookeeper snapshot integrity
    return validate_zk_snapshot_structure(snapshot)
    
  # Other method implementations

class ZookeeperRestoreDriver implements RestoreDriver:
  # Implementation of restore operations for Zookeeper
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each technology plugin
2. Integration tests with actual database instances
3. Snapshot consistency validation tests
4. Restore validation tests
5. Performance tests with varying database sizes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Zookeeper Backup/Restore Plugin [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a plugin for the backup and restore framework that supports Zookeeper database technology
### Details:
Research Zookeeper's native backup mechanisms. Implement the BackupDriver interface for creating consistent snapshots of Zookeeper data. Develop the RestoreDriver interface for restoring Zookeeper from snapshots. Include validation logic to verify snapshot integrity and successful restoration. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms specific to Zookeeper operations.

## 2. Implement Docstore Backup/Restore Plugin [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a plugin for the backup and restore framework that supports Docstore database technology
### Details:
Research Docstore's backup mechanisms and consistency requirements. Implement the BackupDriver interface for creating consistent snapshots of Docstore data. Develop the RestoreDriver interface for restoring Docstore from snapshots. Include validation logic to verify document integrity and indexing after restoration. Implement Docstore-specific error handling and recovery procedures.

## 3. Implement Schemaless Backup/Restore Plugin [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a plugin for the backup and restore framework that supports Schemaless database technology
### Details:
Research Schemaless database backup mechanisms and consistency requirements. Implement the BackupDriver interface for creating consistent snapshots of Schemaless data. Develop the RestoreDriver interface for restoring Schemaless from snapshots. Include validation logic to verify data integrity after restoration. Implement Schemaless-specific error handling and recovery procedures.

## 4. Integrate and Test All Database Technology Plugins [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Perform comprehensive integration testing of all implemented database technology plugins within the backup and restore frameworks
### Details:
Integrate all three plugins (Zookeeper, Docstore, Schemaless) with the existing backup and restore frameworks. Verify plugin discovery and registration mechanisms work correctly. Test cross-technology scenarios where appropriate. Validate monitoring integration for all plugins. Perform load testing to ensure system stability under various conditions.

## 5. Create Documentation and Deployment Package [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation and prepare deployment package for the extended database technology support
### Details:
Document technology-specific considerations, limitations, and best practices for each database plugin. Create user guides for configuring backup and restore operations for each technology. Update system architecture documentation to reflect the new plugins. Prepare deployment packages including configuration templates. Document performance characteristics and resource requirements.
