# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Unified Restore Driver Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a plugin-based framework for database-specific restore operations that standardizes the download and restore process across different database technologies.
# Details:
Design and implement a unified restore driver framework that mirrors the backup driver framework. Each plugin should handle the specifics of restoring snapshots for its database type and manage the download process from Uber Blobstore.

Components:
- Base restore driver interface defining common restore operations
- Plugin registration and discovery mechanism
- Technology-specific implementations for MySQL, Cassandra, etcd initially
- Validation of restored databases
- Error handling and retry logic

Pseudo-code:
```
interface RestoreDriver:
  def download_snapshot(reference) -> Snapshot
  def prepare_restore(snapshot, target) -> bool
  def execute_restore(snapshot, target) -> RestoreResult
  def validate_restored_db(target) -> ValidationResult

class MySQLRestoreDriver implements RestoreDriver:
  def download_snapshot(reference):
    # Download MySQL snapshot from blobstore
    return mysql_snapshot
    
  def prepare_restore(snapshot, target):
    # Prepare target for MySQL restore
    return is_prepared
    
  # Other method implementations

# Similar implementations for Cassandra, etcd, etc.
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each database technology restore driver
2. Integration tests with actual database instances in test environment
3. Restore validation tests
4. Performance tests to validate RTO targets
5. Error handling and recovery tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement base restore driver interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core interface that defines common restore operations across all database technologies
### Details:
Develop the RestoreDriver interface with methods for download_snapshot, prepare_restore, execute_restore, and validate_restored_db. Include error handling patterns, retry logic specifications, and documentation for plugin developers. Define clear contracts for each method including parameter requirements and return values.

## 2. Implement plugin registration and discovery mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a system for dynamically registering and discovering restore driver plugins for different database technologies
### Details:
Develop a plugin registry that allows restore drivers to register themselves at runtime. Implement a discovery mechanism that can find and load plugins from predefined locations. Create a factory pattern for instantiating the appropriate restore driver based on database type. Include versioning support for plugins to allow multiple versions to coexist.

## 3. Implement MySQL restore driver [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create the MySQL-specific implementation of the restore driver interface
### Details:
Implement MySQLRestoreDriver that handles MySQL-specific restore operations. Include logic for downloading MySQL snapshots from Uber Blobstore, preparing target instances for restore (stopping services, clearing data directories), executing the restore process with proper configuration, and validating the restored database through connectivity and data integrity checks.

## 4. Implement Cassandra and etcd restore drivers [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create the Cassandra and etcd implementations of the restore driver interface
### Details:
Implement CassandraRestoreDriver and EtcdRestoreDriver classes following the same pattern as the MySQL driver but with technology-specific implementations. Handle the unique aspects of Cassandra's distributed nature and etcd's consensus requirements during restore operations. Include proper validation mechanisms specific to each technology.

## 5. Implement comprehensive error handling and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop robust error handling, retry logic, and monitoring integration for the restore framework
### Details:
Implement standardized error handling across all restore drivers with appropriate retry policies for transient failures. Create detailed error classification to distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors. Integrate with the metrics system to report restore progress, success rates, and timing information. Implement logging for all restore operations with appropriate detail levels for debugging and audit purposes.
