# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Unified Backup Driver Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a plugin-based framework for database-specific backup operations that standardizes the snapshot and upload process across different database technologies.
# Details:
Design and implement a unified driver framework that allows for pluggable database technology support. Each plugin should handle the specifics of creating consistent snapshots for its database type and manage the upload process to Uber Blobstore.

Components:
- Base driver interface defining common backup operations
- Plugin registration and discovery mechanism
- Technology-specific implementations for MySQL, Cassandra, etcd initially
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring integration

Pseudo-code:
```
interface BackupDriver:
  def create_snapshot(db_instance) -> Snapshot
  def validate_snapshot(snapshot) -> bool
  def upload_to_blobstore(snapshot, rate_limit) -> BlobstoreReference
  def cleanup(snapshot) -> bool

class MySQLBackupDriver implements BackupDriver:
  def create_snapshot(db_instance):
    # MySQL-specific snapshot logic
    return mysql_snapshot
    
  def validate_snapshot(snapshot):
    # Validate MySQL snapshot integrity
    return is_valid
    
  # Other method implementations

# Similar implementations for Cassandra, etcd, etc.
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each database technology driver
2. Integration tests with actual database instances in test environment
3. Snapshot consistency validation tests
4. Upload performance tests with different rate limits
5. Error handling and recovery tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Base Driver Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core interface that all database-specific backup drivers must implement, including standard methods for snapshot creation, validation, upload, and cleanup.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive interface definition that standardizes backup operations across database technologies. Include method signatures for create_snapshot(), validate_snapshot(), upload_to_blobstore(), and cleanup() with appropriate parameters and return types. Document each method with clear specifications for expected behavior, error handling, and performance considerations.

## 2. Implement Plugin Registration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a dynamic plugin registration and discovery mechanism that allows database-specific drivers to be registered and loaded at runtime.
### Details:
Develop a plugin system that supports dynamic loading of database drivers. Implement a registry that maintains available driver implementations, handles version compatibility, and provides a clean API for driver discovery. Include configuration options for plugin paths and validation of plugin integrity upon loading.

## 3. Develop MySQL Backup Driver Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the first concrete implementation of the backup driver interface for MySQL databases, handling MySQL-specific snapshot creation and validation.
### Details:
Implement a MySQL-specific backup driver that handles the intricacies of creating consistent database snapshots. Include support for different MySQL versions, handling of InnoDB and MyISAM tables, binary log position tracking, and proper locking mechanisms to ensure consistency without excessive downtime.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Retry Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Design and implement a robust error handling and retry mechanism for backup operations that can recover from transient failures.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive error classification system that distinguishes between recoverable and non-recoverable errors. Implement exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures, circuit breakers for persistent issues, and detailed error reporting. Ensure proper resource cleanup during failures and support for resumable uploads to Blobstore.

## 5. Develop Cassandra and etcd Driver Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Implement backup driver plugins for Cassandra and etcd databases, following the established interface and leveraging database-specific snapshot mechanisms.
### Details:
Create driver implementations for Cassandra and etcd that handle their unique architectures. For Cassandra, implement support for token-aware snapshots, multi-node consistency, and SSTable handling. For etcd, implement support for consistent snapshots via the built-in snapshot mechanism, handling of distributed consensus, and proper version compatibility across the etcd 3.x series.
