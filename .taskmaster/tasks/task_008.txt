# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Compliance and Audit Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive audit logging system for backup and restore operations to support compliance requirements and forensic analysis.
# Details:
Create an audit logging system that records all backup and restore operations, policy changes, and access to backup data. The system should support compliance requirements and provide data for forensic analysis when needed.

Components:
- Audit log schema design
- Logging integration in all system components
- Secure storage for audit logs
- Retention policy for audit data
- Reporting interface for compliance teams

Audit events to log:
- Backup initiation and completion
- Restore initiation and completion
- Policy changes
- Access to backup data
- Configuration changes
- System errors and exceptions

Pseudo-code:
```
class AuditLogger:
  def log_event(event_type, actor, resource, details):
    # Create audit log entry
    entry = {
      'timestamp': current_time(),
      'event_type': event_type,
      'actor': actor,
      'resource': resource,
      'details': details,
      'source_ip': get_source_ip()
    }
    
    # Store audit log securely
    secure_audit_store.append(entry)
    
  def generate_compliance_report(start_time, end_time, filters):
    # Retrieve and format audit logs for compliance reporting
    logs = secure_audit_store.query(start_time, end_time, filters)
    return format_compliance_report(logs)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for audit logging logic
2. Integration tests with all system components
3. Compliance report generation tests
4. Security tests for audit log storage
5. Retention policy enforcement tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Audit Log Schema and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive schema for audit logs and implement secure storage mechanisms for long-term retention.
### Details:
Design a schema that captures all required audit events including timestamp, event type, actor, resource, details, and source IP. Implement secure storage with encryption at rest and in transit. Define retention periods based on compliance requirements (e.g., 7 years for financial data). Include tamper-proof mechanisms to prevent log modification.

## 2. Implement Core Audit Logging Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop the central AuditLogger service that will capture and store all system events according to the defined schema.
### Details:
Implement the AuditLogger class with methods for logging different event types. Include functionality for batching log entries during high-volume operations. Ensure thread safety for concurrent logging operations. Implement retry mechanisms for failed log storage attempts. Add context enrichment to automatically capture environment details.

## 3. Integrate Audit Logging Across System Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add audit logging calls to all system components to capture backup/restore operations, policy changes, and data access events.
### Details:
Integrate the AuditLogger into the BackupManager, RestoreManager, PolicyManager, and AccessControl components. Implement aspect-oriented logging for cross-cutting concerns. Create standardized logging patterns for common operations. Ensure all required events (backup/restore operations, policy changes, data access, configuration changes, errors) are captured with appropriate detail.

## 4. Develop Compliance Reporting Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a reporting system that allows compliance teams to query, filter, and export audit logs for regulatory purposes.
### Details:
Implement the generate_compliance_report method with flexible filtering options. Create predefined report templates for common compliance requirements (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA). Add export capabilities in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, JSON). Implement access controls to restrict report access to authorized compliance personnel. Include data aggregation for summary reports.

## 5. Implement Forensic Analysis Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Enhance the audit system with advanced search, correlation, and visualization features for forensic analysis of security incidents.
### Details:
Develop advanced search capabilities with complex query support. Implement event correlation to link related activities. Create visualization tools for activity timelines. Add anomaly detection for suspicious patterns. Implement chain-of-custody tracking for forensic investigations. Include the ability to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to an incident.
