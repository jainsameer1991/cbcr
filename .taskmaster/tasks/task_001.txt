# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Adaptive Backup Scheduler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the central orchestrator with adaptive scheduling capabilities to manage backup operations across different database technologies.
# Details:
Create a scheduler service that dynamically adjusts backup timing based on workload, network, and host capacity. Implement rate limiting to prevent resource spikes during peak business traffic. The scheduler should support configurable policies per database technology and maintain a queue of pending backup jobs.

Key components:
- Scheduler core with priority queue
- Rate limiting mechanism based on network/host metrics
- Workload detection to defer during peak traffic
- Database technology-specific scheduling parameters
- Monitoring hooks for backup job status

Pseudo-code:
```
class AdaptiveScheduler:
  def schedule_backup(db_instance, tech_type, priority):
    # Check current system load
    if system_load > threshold && priority != HIGH:
      requeue_with_backoff(db_instance)
      return
    
    # Check network capacity
    if network_capacity < required_capacity:
      requeue_with_backoff(db_instance)
      return
      
    # Schedule backup with rate limiting
    enqueue_backup_job(db_instance, tech_type)
    
  def process_queue():
    # Process queue based on priority and capacity
    while queue not empty && capacity available:
      job = queue.dequeue()
      execute_backup_job(job)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for scheduling logic and rate limiting
2. Integration tests with simulated high/low system load
3. Load testing with varying numbers of database instances
4. Validation that backups don't cause latency spikes in production workloads
5. Metrics collection to verify absence of backup-induced latency events

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement scheduler core with priority queue [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the central scheduler component with a priority-based queue system that manages pending backup jobs
### Details:
Implement the core scheduler class with a priority queue data structure that sorts backup jobs based on urgency, database type, and size. Include methods for adding, removing, and processing jobs. Implement the queue processing logic that handles job execution based on available system resources.

## 2. Develop rate limiting mechanism based on system metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a system that monitors network and host metrics to dynamically adjust backup execution rates
### Details:
Implement collectors for system metrics including CPU usage, memory availability, network bandwidth, and I/O capacity. Create a rate limiting algorithm that uses these metrics to determine how many concurrent backup jobs can run. Implement backoff strategies for when system resources are constrained.

## 3. Implement workload detection for peak traffic deferral [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Build a mechanism to detect high business traffic periods and defer non-critical backups accordingly
### Details:
Create a workload detection service that monitors database query patterns, application traffic metrics, and time-based patterns to identify peak business hours. Implement logic to defer low-priority backups during these periods while still ensuring critical backups proceed. Include configurable thresholds for different database technologies.

## 4. Develop database technology-specific scheduling parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create configurable scheduling policies for different database technologies (MySQL, Cassandra, etcd, etc.)
### Details:
Design and implement a configuration system for database-specific scheduling parameters including optimal backup windows, resource requirements, and priority levels. Create default profiles for common database technologies. Implement the integration between these parameters and the scheduler core to ensure technology-appropriate scheduling decisions.

## 5. Implement monitoring hooks and status tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive system to track and report on backup job status and scheduler performance
### Details:
Implement monitoring hooks throughout the scheduler to track job status, queue length, execution times, and resource utilization. Create interfaces for external monitoring systems to consume these metrics. Implement logging for scheduler decisions and job lifecycle events. Design and implement status reporting APIs for integration with dashboards.
