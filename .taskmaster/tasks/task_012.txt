# Task ID: 12
# Title: Integrate with Capacity Planning Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the CBCR system with Uber's capacity planning tools to ensure appropriate resource allocation and forecast future needs.
# Details:
Develop integration with Uber's capacity planning infrastructure to ensure the CBCR system has appropriate resources allocated and can forecast future needs based on growth trends.

Components:
- Resource usage reporting
- Growth trend analysis
- Capacity forecasting
- Integration with infrastructure provisioning
- Optimization recommendations

Integration points:
1. Report current resource utilization to capacity planning systems
2. Receive resource allocation updates
3. Provide growth forecasts based on backup volume trends
4. Request additional resources based on projected needs
5. Optimize resource usage based on recommendations

Pseudo-code:
```
class CapacityManager:
  def report_resource_usage():
    # Collect current resource usage metrics
    usage = {
      'storage': collect_storage_usage(),
      'network': collect_network_usage(),
      'compute': collect_compute_usage()
    }
    
    # Report to capacity planning system
    capacity_planning_client.report_usage(usage)
    
  def forecast_future_needs(horizon_days):
    # Analyze growth trends
    storage_growth = analyze_storage_growth_trend()
    backup_count_growth = analyze_backup_count_trend()
    
    # Project future needs
    forecast = {
      'storage': project_storage_needs(storage_growth, horizon_days),
      'network': project_network_needs(backup_count_growth, horizon_days),
      'compute': project_compute_needs(backup_count_growth, horizon_days)
    }
    
    # Report forecast to capacity planning
    capacity_planning_client.report_forecast(forecast)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for resource usage collection
2. Integration tests with capacity planning systems
3. Forecast accuracy validation
4. Resource optimization tests
5. End-to-end workflow tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Resource Usage Reporting Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to collect and report current resource utilization metrics to Uber's capacity planning systems
### Details:
Create a module that collects storage, network, and compute usage metrics from the CBCR system. Implement the report_resource_usage() method to aggregate these metrics and send them to capacity planning systems via their API. Include appropriate error handling and retry logic for failed reporting attempts.

## 2. Develop Growth Trend Analysis Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create an analytics engine to analyze historical resource usage data and identify growth patterns
### Details:
Build a data analysis component that processes historical resource usage data to identify growth trends in storage consumption, backup frequency, and compute resource utilization. Implement statistical models to detect seasonal patterns and long-term growth trajectories. Store analysis results for use in forecasting.

## 3. Implement Capacity Forecasting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Build a forecasting system that projects future resource needs based on identified growth trends
### Details:
Develop the forecast_future_needs() method that uses growth trend data to project future resource requirements across storage, network, and compute dimensions. Implement configurable forecast horizons (e.g., 30, 90, 180 days). Generate confidence intervals for forecasts and provide visualization capabilities for capacity planning teams.

## 4. Create Infrastructure Provisioning Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop integration points with Uber's infrastructure provisioning systems to request and receive resource allocation updates
### Details:
Implement bidirectional integration with Uber's infrastructure provisioning systems. Create APIs to receive resource allocation updates and apply them to the CBCR system. Develop request workflows to automatically or manually trigger resource requests based on forecasted needs. Include approval workflows for significant resource increases.

## 5. Build Resource Optimization Recommendation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3
### Description: Develop a system to generate and apply resource optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
### Details:
Create an optimization engine that analyzes resource usage patterns to identify inefficiencies and generate recommendations for improvement. Implement algorithms to detect over-provisioning, underutilization, and cost-saving opportunities. Develop interfaces to present recommendations to administrators and apply approved optimizations automatically.
