# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Multi-region Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the CBCR system to support multi-region backup storage and restore capabilities to meet compliance and disaster recovery requirements.
# Details:
Enhance the system to support multi-region backup storage and restore operations. Implement region-specific policies for data storage and ensure compliance with regional data regulations.

Components:
- Region-aware backup storage policies
- Cross-region restore capabilities
- Region-specific retention rules
- Compliance enforcement per region
- Performance optimization for cross-region operations

Pseudo-code:
```
class RegionManager:
  def get_storage_regions(db_instance):
    # Determine appropriate storage regions based on policies
    primary_region = db_instance.region
    secondary_regions = get_secondary_regions(db_instance.type, primary_region)
    return [primary_region] + secondary_regions
    
  def store_backup_multi_region(snapshot, regions):
    # Store backup in multiple regions
    references = []
    for region in regions:
      reference = blobstore_client.upload_to_region(snapshot, region)
      references.append(reference)
    return references
    
  def restore_from_region(db_instance, target_region):
    # Find appropriate backup in target region or nearest available
    reference = find_backup_in_region(db_instance, target_region)
    if not reference:
      reference = find_nearest_region_backup(db_instance, target_region)
      
    # Execute restore from selected region
    return execute_restore(reference, db_instance)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for region selection logic
2. Integration tests with multi-region Blobstore
3. Cross-region restore tests
4. Compliance validation tests
5. Performance tests for cross-region operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Region-aware Backup Storage Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a framework for defining and enforcing region-specific backup storage policies based on database type, compliance requirements, and disaster recovery needs.
### Details:
Develop a policy definition schema that includes primary and secondary regions, data residency rules, and compliance requirements. Implement the get_storage_regions method to determine appropriate storage regions based on these policies. Create a configuration system for administrators to define region mappings and preferences.

## 2. Implement Multi-region Backup Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Extend the backup system to store snapshots across multiple regions according to the defined policies.
### Details:
Implement the store_backup_multi_region method to distribute backups across specified regions. Create a tracking system for multi-region backup references. Develop retry and fallback mechanisms for region unavailability. Optimize parallel upload capabilities to minimize backup time across regions.

## 3. Develop Cross-region Restore Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create functionality to restore databases from any available region with intelligent region selection based on proximity and availability.
### Details:
Implement the restore_from_region method to locate and restore backups from specified regions. Develop algorithms for finding the nearest available backup when the target region is unavailable. Create a region health monitoring system to detect outages. Optimize data transfer paths for cross-region restores.

## 4. Implement Region-specific Retention Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop a system to manage backup retention according to region-specific compliance and regulatory requirements.
### Details:
Create a retention rule engine that enforces different retention periods based on region and data classification. Implement automated cleanup processes for expired backups in each region. Develop override mechanisms for legal holds across regions. Ensure retention metadata is properly tracked and enforced.

## 5. Optimize Performance for Cross-region Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Enhance the system performance for multi-region backup and restore operations through caching, compression, and intelligent data routing.
### Details:
Implement region-aware data compression to reduce transfer sizes. Develop a caching layer for frequently accessed backup metadata. Create intelligent routing algorithms to minimize cross-region data transfer costs. Implement bandwidth throttling to prevent network saturation. Develop performance monitoring specific to multi-region operations.
