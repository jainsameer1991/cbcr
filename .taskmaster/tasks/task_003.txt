# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate with Uber Blobstore
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the integration with Uber Blobstore for storing backup snapshots with appropriate rate control and retention policies.
# Details:
Develop the integration layer between the backup system and Uber Blobstore. Implement rate-controlled uploads to prevent network spikes, configure appropriate retention policies, and ensure proper metadata tagging for snapshots.

Components:
- Blobstore client with rate limiting capabilities
- Metadata management for snapshots (database type, timestamp, size, etc.)
- Retention policy enforcement
- Multi-region support for compliance requirements
- Upload status tracking and reporting

Pseudo-code:
```
class BlobstoreManager:
  def upload_snapshot(snapshot, rate_limit):
    # Apply rate limiting
    throttled_stream = create_throttled_stream(snapshot.data, rate_limit)
    
    # Prepare metadata
    metadata = {
      'db_type': snapshot.db_type,
      'timestamp': snapshot.timestamp,
      'size': snapshot.size,
      'region': snapshot.region,
      'retention_policy': get_retention_policy(snapshot.db_type)
    }
    
    # Upload to blobstore with metadata
    reference = blobstore_client.upload(throttled_stream, metadata)
    return reference
    
  def apply_retention_policies():
    # Scan for snapshots beyond retention period
    expired = find_expired_snapshots()
    for snapshot in expired:
      blobstore_client.delete(snapshot.reference)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for rate limiting logic
2. Integration tests with Uber Blobstore
3. Performance tests with various snapshot sizes
4. Retention policy enforcement tests
5. Network impact monitoring during uploads

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Blobstore Client with Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a client for Uber Blobstore with built-in rate limiting capabilities to prevent network spikes during uploads
### Details:
Implement a client wrapper for Uber Blobstore API that includes configurable rate limiting. The client should handle authentication, connection pooling, and throttled data streaming. Include retry logic for transient failures and proper error handling.

## 2. Implement Snapshot Metadata Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a system for managing and storing metadata associated with backup snapshots
### Details:
Design and implement a metadata schema for backup snapshots including database type, timestamp, size, region, and other relevant attributes. Develop functions to generate, validate, and attach metadata to snapshots during upload. Ensure metadata is searchable and can be used for filtering snapshots.

## 3. Develop Retention Policy Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create a configurable framework for defining and enforcing snapshot retention policies
### Details:
Implement a system to define retention policies based on database type, importance, and compliance requirements. Create a scheduler to regularly scan for and remove snapshots that exceed their retention period. Include logging and audit trails for all deletion operations.

## 4. Implement Multi-region Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Extend the Blobstore integration to support storing snapshots across multiple regions
### Details:
Enhance the Blobstore client to support multi-region storage based on compliance requirements. Implement region selection logic, cross-region replication capabilities, and region-specific retention rules. Ensure proper handling of region-specific authentication and rate limits.

## 5. Create Upload Status Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
### Description: Develop a system to track and report on the status of snapshot uploads to Blobstore
### Details:
Implement a tracking system that monitors the progress of snapshot uploads, records success/failure status, and provides reporting capabilities. Include real-time progress indicators, error classification, and retry management. Integrate with the metrics system to expose upload performance statistics.
