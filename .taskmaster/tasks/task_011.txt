# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Scalability Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the CBCR system to handle the required scale of 100 PB+ daily backup across 10k+ databases with appropriate performance and resource utilization.
# Details:
Enhance the system to meet the scalability requirements specified in the PRD. Implement optimizations for handling large backup volumes, high database counts, and efficient resource utilization.

Components:
- Distributed backup processing
- Efficient queue management
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Performance optimizations for large snapshots
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

Optimization areas:
1. Parallel processing of backup/restore operations
2. Chunking of large snapshots
3. Efficient metadata indexing
4. Resource pooling and reuse
5. Adaptive throttling based on system load

Pseudo-code:
```
class ScalableBackupProcessor:
  def process_large_backup(db_instance):
    # Estimate backup size and resource requirements
    estimated_size = estimate_backup_size(db_instance)
    
    if estimated_size > LARGE_BACKUP_THRESHOLD:
      # Split into chunks for parallel processing
      chunks = plan_backup_chunks(db_instance, estimated_size)
      
      # Process chunks in parallel with resource constraints
      results = parallel_process_with_constraints(chunks, available_resources)
      
      # Combine results
      return combine_chunk_results(results)
    else:
      # Process normally for smaller backups
      return process_standard_backup(db_instance)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Load testing with simulated 10k+ database instances
2. Performance testing with large (multi-TB) databases
3. Resource utilization monitoring during peak loads
4. Scalability validation with increasing workloads
5. Long-running stability tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Distributed Backup Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a distributed processing framework that can efficiently handle backup operations across 10k+ databases simultaneously
### Details:
Create a distributed processing architecture that can scale horizontally across multiple worker nodes. Implement work distribution algorithms that efficiently allocate backup tasks based on database size, priority, and available resources. Include failure recovery mechanisms to handle worker node failures without losing backup progress.

## 2. Develop Chunking System for Large Snapshots [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement an intelligent chunking system that can break down large database snapshots (multi-TB) into manageable pieces for parallel processing
### Details:
Design algorithms to analyze database structure and determine optimal chunk boundaries. Implement metadata tracking for chunk reassembly. Create a parallel processing pipeline that can efficiently process chunks while maintaining data consistency. Include verification mechanisms to ensure chunk integrity during processing and storage.

## 3. Implement Resource-Aware Scheduling [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create an intelligent scheduling system that optimizes backup operations based on available system resources and prioritization rules
### Details:
Develop a resource monitoring system that tracks CPU, memory, network, and storage utilization. Implement adaptive scheduling algorithms that can throttle or accelerate backup operations based on current system load. Create priority queues that ensure critical backups are processed first while maintaining overall system stability.

## 4. Optimize Metadata Indexing and Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Enhance the metadata management system to efficiently handle indexing and retrieval for 100 PB+ of backup data
### Details:
Redesign the metadata database schema for optimal query performance at scale. Implement sharding and partitioning strategies to distribute metadata across multiple storage nodes. Create efficient caching mechanisms for frequently accessed metadata. Develop background processes for metadata maintenance and optimization.

## 5. Implement Horizontal Scaling Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Develop infrastructure and orchestration components that enable automatic scaling of the CBCR system based on workload demands
### Details:
Create infrastructure-as-code templates for deploying additional processing nodes. Implement auto-scaling triggers based on queue depth, processing latency, and resource utilization metrics. Develop load balancing mechanisms to distribute work evenly across the cluster. Include graceful node addition/removal processes to maintain system stability during scaling events.
