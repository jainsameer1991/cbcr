# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Backup Policies UI/API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface and API for configuring backup policies, including scheduling parameters and retention rules per database technology.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive UI and API for service owners to configure backup policies for their databases. The interface should allow setting of scheduling parameters, retention periods, and priority levels per database or database cluster.

Components:
- RESTful API for policy management
- UI for policy configuration in the internal platform console
- Policy validation logic
- Database of policy configurations
- Audit logging for policy changes

API Endpoints:
```
GET /api/backup/policies - List all policies
GET /api/backup/policies/{id} - Get specific policy
POST /api/backup/policies - Create new policy
PUT /api/backup/policies/{id} - Update policy
DELETE /api/backup/policies/{id} - Delete policy

Policy JSON schema:
{
  "db_identifier": "string",
  "db_type": "string",
  "schedule": {
    "frequency": "string",
    "preferred_window": "string",
    "priority": "string"
  },
  "retention": {
    "period_days": "number",
    "min_snapshots": "number"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for API endpoints and validation logic
2. UI component tests
3. Integration tests with policy enforcement
4. User acceptance testing with service owners
5. Audit log verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement RESTful API for backup policy management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the backend API endpoints for managing backup policies with proper validation and error handling
### Details:
Implement the five RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) according to the specified schema. Include validation logic for policy parameters based on database type. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting. Implement authentication and authorization checks. Create database models for storing policy configurations.

## 2. Develop UI components for policy configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create the user interface components for the internal platform console to configure backup policies
### Details:
Design and implement UI components for policy creation, editing, and deletion. Include forms for scheduling parameters (frequency, preferred window, priority), retention rules (period days, min snapshots), and database-specific options. Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance. Implement client-side validation to complement server-side checks.

## 3. Implement database-specific policy validation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create validation rules for backup policies based on the specific requirements of different database technologies
### Details:
Develop validation rules for MySQL, Cassandra, and etcd backup policies. Implement checks for valid scheduling parameters based on database type (e.g., minimum backup frequency, valid time windows). Create validation for retention policies considering database size and recovery point objectives. Ensure policies comply with organizational data retention requirements.

## 4. Create audit logging system for policy changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all backup policy modifications
### Details:
Design and implement an audit logging system that captures all policy creation, modification, and deletion events. Record user information, timestamp, action type, and before/after policy states. Ensure logs are securely stored and cannot be modified. Implement a query interface for retrieving audit logs with filtering capabilities.

## 5. Integrate policy UI/API with scheduler system [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Connect the backup policy configuration system with the adaptive backup scheduler
### Details:
Integrate the policy management system with the adaptive backup scheduler from Task 1. Implement notification mechanisms to inform the scheduler of policy changes. Ensure real-time policy updates are reflected in scheduling decisions. Create a dashboard to display upcoming scheduled backups based on configured policies.
